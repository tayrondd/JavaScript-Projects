to make it work:

Google and Apple changed the policy on how their browsers ( Chrome and Safari ) allow sounds to be played without user interaction.

I was able to get Angela's example to work by permissioning my page to play sounds through the Chrome Settings.

Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Site Settings -> Sound

Then I copy pasted the URL from my Live Preview of my site into the "Allow" section of the settings.

Cheers
